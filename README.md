We based our work on this awesome work ðŸ‘€ --> [ðŸ¦™ LaMa: Resolution-robust Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions](https://saic-mdal.github.io/lama-project/)

## Improvement on Image inpainting with Fourier Convolutions

With the recent development of deep learning, excellent performance is being shown in the field of image inpainting, which includes tasks such as removing unnecessary parts from the image and naturally solving them or recovering certain partially damaged images. The purpose is to use the context present in the image to fill a masked region with plausible pixel values, capable of fooling a discriminator into saying the image was not modified.

In this work we implemented the recently presented network architecture LaMa[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07161), which uses Fourier convolutions to inpaint images containing larges mask, while being robust to resolution. We also proposed two changes, evaluating them with the same metrics used in the original paper.

### Large Mask Inpainting

Roman et al. introduced LaMa [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07161)(Large Mask Inpainting) model in 2021. It showed great result in image inpainting, by using Fourier convolutions. This innovative method of Fourier convolution was introdced in NeurIPS 2020 [[nips]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/2fd5d41ec6cfab47e32164d5624269b1-Paper.pdf) . It allows model to work on frequency domain so that we can have large receptive fields.
Receptive field is an important aspect in deep learning. It defines the region in the input data that produces the features.
Large receptive field helps to â€œunderstandâ€œ large-scale structure such as patterns of natural images and to perform image synthesis.
For this there is two ways :
* Deep network : but problematic appear when propagating gradient until early layers
* Frequency domain : early layers have access to all image frequency synthesis

Using frequency domain allow early layers to have access full image information. 
And this information can be used to generate plausible image.

### Our experiments

* Changing the original loss function to add Wasserstein GAN Loss function
* Changing local convolution to spectral convolution
